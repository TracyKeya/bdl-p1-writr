- Instructor: John Foley
- CS341BD - Building a Digital Library
- Spring 2017, Mount Holyoke College

## What's in the repository now:
*Writr*, a guestbook-style web app, the suggested starter code for this project.

## Motivation & Learning Goals

This programming assignment is designed to be a fairly simple chance to program something open-ended. It will introduce web technologies from the server side, through the use of the embedded Jetty HTTP library. Since the web service loses its data every time it restarts, we will be introduced to the ideas of serving web content without mixing in databases just yet. We will see the challenges of building a testable system in this domain, and work on ways to overcome them.
